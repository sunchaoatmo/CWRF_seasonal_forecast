    "1. Initial set up: Ensure that you have access to the necessary data for following evaluation work. This may include access to the CFS data source, as well as any necessary software or tools required for downloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the input parameters: The command line should accept input parameters for the initial date, end of the simulation, and variables of interest. This will allow the script to automatically download the relevant data for the specified time range and variables.\n",
